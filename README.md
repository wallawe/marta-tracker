## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Next steps

- mobilize
- perhaps move some state to context
- add prop types
- double check accessibility
- more design niceness
- countdown to the next train instead of showing time it arrives.
